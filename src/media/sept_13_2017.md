# measuring infinity
What is the difference between the size of infinities?

Is there space between the measure of the size of the natural numbers and the
size of tbe real numbers?

I have not deeply studied the subject - but what strikes my intuition is a need
for multiple dimensions of measure. The natural numbers are a single dimension,
in that they consist of a single incremental.

Real numbers on the other hand, behave differently - for every incremental increase
in one direction, there is another incremental increase in another, and so on recursively.

So what is this? It feels fractal
(in its need of dimension).
